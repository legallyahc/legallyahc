### Hey!

I'm Alice (she/her), an undergraduate student in Sustainability, Science, and Society at McGill University. I have a penchant for R 
and the interesting software ecosystem that surrounds it. My public repos tend to deal with toy projects ([volcanic](https://github.com/legallyahc/volcanic), 
[ahcttc](https://github.com/legallyahc/ahcttc), and [speed](https://github.com/legallyahc/speed)) or the occassional academic feature 
([geog351-finalproject](https://github.com/legallyahc/geog351-finalproject)) and hopefully will host some larger things in the future.

Because I imagine this website is pretty heavily trawled, you can contact me by forking a public repo and leaving some obvious message. I'll leave a nice website here when I have one.
