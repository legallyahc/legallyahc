### Hey!

I'm Alice (she/her), a Sustainability (think Geography + Environment) graduate from McGill University. I have a penchant for R 
and the interesting software ecosystem that surrounds it. My public repos tend to deal with toy projects ([volcanic](https://github.com/legallyahc/volcanic) and 
[ahcttc](https://github.com/legallyahc/ahcttc)), the occassional academic feature 
([geog351-finalproject](https://github.com/legallyahc/geog351-finalproject)), and collaborative sites ([speed](https://github.com/legallyahc/speed)) and hopefully will host some larger things in the future.

Because I imagine this website is pretty heavily trawled, you check the [Contact](https://ahclauss.com/contact) part of my website if you'd like to chat. Or make a pull request saying you'd like to chat; that'd be silly. Either way, it's nice to hear from you ☺️
